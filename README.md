# Nodetomation
A Node.js automation system for Raspberry Pi & Arduino.

## Description
Nodetomation is an open source system that automates components actions based on events.

There many events sources as the user interaction (eg: click on the UI dashboard), a schedule (eg: every sunday at 8 am), or a component event (eg: the temperature sensor says that temp is over 80Â°F).

Components are pluggable, they have events and/or actions and can be of any kind: physical ones (eg: a camera with a proximity sensor triggering the "move captured" event, or executing the "take a photo" action) or logical ones (eg: an email service triggering the "email arrived" event, or executing the "send email" action).

### Current features
